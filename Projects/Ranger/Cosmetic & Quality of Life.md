# Sound Deadening 
I wanted to reduce the noises which I was hearing while driving, especially on the freeway.

I started by pulling the interior

I pressure washed and bleached the carpet and floor

Then installed a product called "siless", which is an 0.08" thick butyl rubber sheet with a layer of aluminum. My understanding is by adding some heavy material which is very mechanically lossy, the noise from panel vibration is reduced.

I installed this material on the floor, back wall, inside the doors, and on the roof.
