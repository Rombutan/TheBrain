After compression testing and realizing there was no compression, we removed the valve cover again to check timing. We were thinking the valves weren't opening at the right times, and we were right.

There is a QR code on each camshaft which indicates which side should be facing up at TDC on cylinder 1. In this photo, the engine is at TDC, but the bottom (exhaust) cam is about 180 degrees off and the top one is about 90 degrees off.

After retiming the cams and vanos plate things, it had compression:

We drained the oil:

And the engine also ran after reinstalling the valve cover:

But it produced a TON of white smoke...
The white smoke also comes from the engine bay on the exaust side...
The only code generated was a misfire on cylinder 5...

Plugs (in no particular order):

We reinstalled the plugs, making sure the dirtiest one went in cylinder 5... it didn't get much cleaner.

We compression tested every cylinder with 3 compression strokes each:

| Cylinder | PSI 3 cranks |
| -------- | ------------ |
| 1        | 165          |
| 2        | 175          |
| 3        | 180          |
| 4        | 185          |
| 5        | 190          |
| 6        | 200          |

The fresh oil was also very milky after that amount of running... maybe not as milky as before, but very milky.

So that's where we're at.
