## V6

![[versaroller shooter.excalidraw]]

Too much compression stalled the motor :(

## V7
![[wackytestshooteriso.png]]

Features variable comrpession
Failed to spin fast enough (too much friction)
Compression Transition is too difficult for the shot to be good


## V8
Trying single sided rollers, geared up 2:1, so low need everything to be low friction
![[v8 shooter.excalidraw]]
![[v8shootertest.mov]]

It's very difficult to transfer enough energy to the note for it to go fast enough. The above test was at ~9250 output RPM, which works out to 80 feet/second

## V8.5
Adding grip tape significantly improved performance because the game piece kinda "rolls" out of the shooter instead of spinning in place

Taking inspiration for 6328 pod thing

## V10

![[v10 shooter test.mp4]]
**Changes Needed:**
- 3+7/8 wheels
- Keep same compression on feeder with 2+3/8 wheels
- beam break mounting
- First idler a bit closer to feeder rollers
- Tube for parallelogram
- Motor not in path of note


## V11
**Cad Review:**
- [x] Cad nicer *shiloh* idler rolers
- [x] More clearance on pod plate standoffs
- [x] cad right length shafts
- [x] add pulley to high speed reverser shafts
- [x] spacers (Not in CAD)
- [x] ~~Join pulleys for length reduction / backlash / not rounding out~~ âœ… 2024-03-07

![[is it really worth it though?.excalidraw]]

![[some_shooter_mass.png]]

**Cad Review:**
- [x] Clearance for belt tensioner
- [x] Back to 3:1 on feeder
- [x] Cad feeder tubes
- [x] Swap pulley with reverser plate
	- [x] make reverser plate bigger

### settings
80, 49 - good
80, 59 - not good (breaker issues)
80, 59 - fine but unstable
80, 65 - less stable
80, 55 - more stable but still mid
90, 55 - more stable but mid
45, 60 - dips hard
35, 45 - wobbly


Try 8000, 5000 rpm...

#### Rectangle Tube Bending Calculation
Area moment of 1x1
$$ \frac{1-0.875^4}{12} = 0.03448 $$

Deflection at 30 lbs (Accelerating the end 3 lbs at 10 G's)
$$ \frac{30*15^3}{3*9993118.2*0.03448} = 0.0907 $$

Deflection at 150 lbs (Worst case robot loading)
$$ \frac{150*15^3}{3*9993118.2*0.03448} = 0.4897 $$

Area moment  of 1x2 (weak way)
$$ \frac{1^3 * 2}{12} - \frac{0.875^3*1.875}{12} = 0.06199 $$

Area moment  of 1x2 (strong way)
$$ \frac{2^3}{12} - \frac{0.875*1.875^3}{12} = 0.18 $$

Deflection at 30 lbs (weak way) (Accelerating the end 3 lbs 
at 10 G's)
$$ \frac{30*15^3}{3*9993118.2*0.06199} = 0.0544 $$

Deflection at 30 lbs (strong way) (Accelerating the end 3 lbs 
at 10 G's)
$$ \frac{30*15^3}{3*9993118.2*0.18} = 0.0187 $$

Deflection at 150 lbs (strong way) (Worst Case Robot Loading)
$$ \frac{150*15^3}{3*9993118.2*0.18} = 0.09078 $$
