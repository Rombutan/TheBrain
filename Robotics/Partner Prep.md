# Checklist
**Minimum Checks (Specifically tell Luca before match if missed)**
M1. Match battery checked (leads tight, firm tug, voltage > 12 on PDH or 12.5 on beak)
M2. Radio power connections checked (PDH/PDP -> Radio)
M3. RIO power connections checked (PDH/PDP -> RIO)
M4. Ethernet path checked (RIO -> Radio, inc. switch power)
M5. Main power (Robot SB50 -> PDH/PDP)
M6. CAN functioning in pit (happy lights)

**Best Practice checks**
B1. CAN loop connectors checked (gentle tugs, install clips/zip ties on dupont)
B2. Bumpers fully attached (and correct color)
B3. Drive Systems Check (ask them to drive straight, check each wheel direction and rotation)

**Extended Checks (When time allows and teams are cooperative)**
E1. Full systems check with note
E2. Check packet loss in driver station from last match (peaks < 10%)
E3. Check CAN utilization in driver station from last match (peaks < 30%)
E4. Check battery voltage in driver station from last match (peaks > 8v)

**Things Luca will check in queue**
L1. Battery connector zip tied
L2. Battery secured to robot
L3. Battery showing good on pdh on field

**Most Common Issues**
-  Main breaker lugs loose
 - Battery lugs loose
 - Battery crimps failing
 - Radio Power failure
 - Anything with an Ethernet cable
