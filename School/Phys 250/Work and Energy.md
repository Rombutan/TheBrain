## Momentum - Center of Mass Theorem
The linear momentum of a system of particles is equal to the product of the total mass M of the system and the velocity of the [[Public/School/Phys 250/Motion of Bodies in Free Space|center of mass]].
## Collisions
Inelastic: Kinetic energy and momentum is conserved
Elastic: Momentum is conserved
## Equations
If Straight
$$ W=Fdcos(\theta) $$
OR
$$ W=\int_A^B{\vec{F} \cdot d \vec{l}} $$
$\theta$ is angle between distance and force

$$ K=0.5â€‹mv^2 $$

$$ \sqrt{\frac{2K}{m}} = v$$

Rotational when $\omega$ is angular velocity and $I$ is moment of inertia:
$$ K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 $$

K is kenetic energy in Jules

$$ \Delta U = mgh $$

- On any path, a force constant in magnitude and direction will do the same amount of work

$$ W_{nc} = U_i + K_i - U_f - K_f $$
