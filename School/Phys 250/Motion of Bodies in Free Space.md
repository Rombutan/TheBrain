Center of mass or barycenter (2 bodies):
$r_c$ is distance of center from $m_1$ along line between bodies
$r$ is distance between bodies
$m$ is masses
$$ r_c = r\frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2} $$

Center of mass or barycenter (n>2 bodies):
(Sum of product of all masses and their associated positions)
$$ \vec{r_c} = \frac{\Large\Sigma \vec{p}m}{\Sigma{m}} $$
