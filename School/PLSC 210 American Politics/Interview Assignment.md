# Interview Reflection
1. **Interview Information:** 
    1. **Interviewee Name (pseudonym is OK):**  Kyle Tennison
    2. **Interview Date:** Wed Apr 23
    3. **Interview Modality (in-person, telephonic, Zoom, etc.):** In-person
    4. **Why did you choose to request an interview with this individual? What is their connection to the problem you decided to focus on for your final essay?**
    I chose this person because they have lived in multiple states so I thought they might talk about the psychological effect of having your vote matter or not in our interview. Also, they will be voting for the first time in the upcoming election, which is somewhat interesting.
2. **Was this your first time conducting an interview? Did you learn anything new about conducting interviews that may  come in handy next time you conduct one?**
I've conducted interviews for HS projects several times. I put much more effort into conducting this interview, since I am more interested in the topic and class at large. I really liked having pre-written questions, and I really liked asking questions that took a while to answer, instead of the really simple questions I normally end up asking.
3. **How did your interviewee’s perceptions align with or differ from your own? What factors do you think influenced these similarities or differences?**
Kyle pretty much agrees with me on most things, I think he grew up in the bay before moving to Arkansas for 2 years, and now he's back... Most of his personality was formed in the bay, so it makes sense that he mostly still holds the same opinions as me.
4. **Include two excerpts (e.g. 2-4 sentences each) from the interview that stood out to you as particularly interesting and/or insightful comments. What stood out to you about each excerpt and how did they each add to your understanding of the topic?**
1) It was interesting to me that Kyle pondered "is it actually better to have someone that most people are okay with instead of someone who half of people really like?" - I don't really have  a good answer for why it is or isn't better, and it's something I want to explore more while writting my final... Thanks Kyle!
2) It was also surprising to me that Kyle focused so much on the additional complexity of RCV and it's difficulty for people with little education or poor english skills to understand. I should have asked him if he related to that personally or something because he focused in on it a lot. I think I still don't really believe that it's that complicated to understand, but I also think I might just need to empathize harder...
5. **How did the insight(s) you gained in the interview add or challenge any prior assumptions you had about the topic? Please elaborate on if and how your previous views were validated or challenged.**
One prior assumption that my interview helped change was my unwavering opinion that a candidate who most people didn't mind is better than one who some people really like. I think in my leadership experience, sometimes you have to commit really hard, and the commitment to a particular path matters more than a path itself. I don't think American politics works like this because of the stakes and complexity, but maybe it does.
6. **What might be some follow-up discussions you might wish to have with the interviewee about the chosen topic in the future?**
I want to ask Kyle if he has a personal reason to mention the difficulty for under educated people to understand RCV so many times. It might not show in my summarized notes, but he really focused in on that a lot, and it makes me very curious.
