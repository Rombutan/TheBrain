How might we reduce the GHG emissions from compost?

1. community level pyrolisis
2. subterranean compost in community gardens
3. sealed at home compost bin, feeding GHG into a mini greenhouse
4. sealed at home compost bin, feeding GHG into algae bioreactor
5. mushrooms?
6. compost bin with more composter organisms
7. app to connect people with good quality compost to farmers for like direct delivery
8. somehow stabalize plant matter and bury it
9. Use waste plant matter as reinforcement in concrete
10. turn all the waste plant matter into mush and store it in sealed concrete tanks which are then burried
11. burn it? At least you get energy...
12. digest into sugar with cellulase
13. digest into alchohal with cellulase and beer yeast
14. animal feed
15. self contained garden bin which uses food waste as fertilizer
16. dehydrate and store as powder
17. dehydrate and deliver to farms as ferilizer
18. dehydrate and pyrolisize
19. vermiculture
20. aerated compost
21. biochar additives into compost
22. at home compost bin with temperature and humidity control
23. subterranean compost with cover crops on top
24. offset GHG with tubes with aquatic plants
25. offset GHG with plytoplankton
26. use for nutrients in hydroponics
27. dehydrate and compress into construction material
28. burn compost into biochar to create biofuel
29. bury biochar underground to sequester carbon dioxide emissions
30. sink biochar containers to the bottom of the ocean (unsure of pros/cons) compared to burial underground.
31. compact compost or products of compost to make storage easier
32. find some bugs that really like chewing down plant matter to speed up composting process
33. use microorganisms to break down the compost faster
34. use micro-organisms that like to break down the harmful emissions of decomposing matter
35. Filter compost facilities so that they don't emit harmful gasses.
36. burn it under extreme temperatures to create graphite
37. Use graphite that's been produced to create pencils
38. directly burn the compost to produce heat energy
39. decompose compost in water- easy to transport with pipes and use plants/micro-organisms that live in water to break the compost down
40. sell composting material to the agricultural industry to make money back from the operating costs of the composting system
41. smart compost bin that yells at you
42. create some local community gardens that could use a lot of compost
43. give compost to local parks?
44. Use compost as landfill (after filtering for emissions)
45. app but compost distribution
46. dating app for compost?
47. sewage system but compost is in it
48. plant waste into clothing
49. compost normally but better
50. filter out harmful emissions and covert them to something useful?
