Reducing GHG Emissions From Compost

#  Prototypes
- Testing by collecting data and determining if it's feasible to connect people like in plan
	- Fake Data
	- Location plot showing that all the people with compost are too far from people who want it
	- Show that few people want compost straight from other people, and NONE are willing to go get it
- Pivot to 

# Design Review Outline
1. The Problem
Re-state the problem you are addressing, being sure to state how your definition of the problem has developed since your last review. Specifically, summarize how your understanding of the problem has changed now that you have tested ideas.

2. The Method
What steps have you taken in your design work since you finished your learning work? Describe the testing process and explain how your prototypes were designed to answer a question or test a specific assumption. Describe the strategies you used to test, including the number and variety of tests conducted.
3. The Deliverables
Show evidence of your work and what you learned from the tests.  Refer to the various deliverables you have completed to date. You should bring your prototype iterations to the design review if possible and discuss how testing led to learning which informed iterations. In addition you can reference information from the testing card and testing notes you collected. Be sure to explain how the various pieces of work demonstrate proficiency on the [LEARN](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fFJ_YFSEHY3yTSztFfuejnCc2sI5AsHqnYzXfR6LMIs/edit) rubric.
4. Questions & Concerns
State clearly the biggest questions you have right now about your project. Identify the reason you think your current prototype is heading in the right direction and next steps you could take to move this idea into implementation.
