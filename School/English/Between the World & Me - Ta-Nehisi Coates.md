Coates makes a point of race being born of racism - that race is not a natural thing. Rather that race is a concept invented by man to dominate other men. 

>But race is the child of racism, not the father. And the process of naming "the people" has never been a matter of genealogy and physiognomy so much as one of hierarchy (p7)

Coates sees the american dream in a beer commercial. The community, the greener than green grass, the barbecues, etc.

I think most people see the american dream as financial stability and a good family life or community. Others prioritize simply being happy, and yet others see overcoming inequity as integral to the American dream.

Personally, I align with the "just be happy" narrative, although I think many people are never setup to achieve the same level as happiness that I am able.
